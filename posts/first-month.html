  <h1 class="post-title">My First Month in Cybersecurity – From Student to Pentesting Intern</h1>

  <article class="post">

    <h2>From CTF Labs to Real-World Security</h2>
    <p>
      Not long ago, cybersecurity for me mostly meant late nights solving CTF challenges and practicing on learning platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box.
      I spent hours going through lab machines, reading write-ups, documenting notes, and building small projects — all driven by curiosity and the desire to understand how systems really break and how they can be defended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I'm working as a cybersecurity student intern, gaining hands-on experience in professional security operations.
      This transition has been both exciting and challenging — it marked my first real step from a learning environment into real-world cybersecurity.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>First Professional Experiences</h2>
    <p>
      During the first month in my new role, I had the opportunity to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Participate in penetration testing engagements</li>
      <li>Conduct digital forensics analysis of devices</li>
      <li>Assist with vulnerability assessment activities</li>
      <li>Learn industry workflows, reporting methodology, and ethical operational practices</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Seeing how real penetration tests differ from CTF labs was eye-opening.
      The technical side is only one piece of the puzzle — documentation, methodology, communication, and responsible handling of findings play just as important a role as exploitation itself.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Continuous Learning Outside of Work</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of my professional work, consistent practice remains a core part of my routine.
      I regularly train on learning platforms such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>TryHackMe (CTF challenges and labs)</li>
      <li>Hack The Box</li>
      <li>PortSwigger Web Security Academy</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These platforms allow me to expand beyond what I encounter day-to-day at work — especially in web security testing, exploitation fundamentals, and vulnerability research.
      I also maintain personal projects, documenting my learning process and technical write-ups on GitHub and in my portfolio.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Advent of Cyber</h2>
    <p>
      One of my favorite learning experiences this year is the <strong>Advent of Cyber</strong> challenge on TryHackMe.
      Completing one challenge per day during December provides structured practice across a wide range of cybersecurity topics —
      from network security and web exploitation to incident response and threat analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s a fun but effective reminder that cybersecurity development is an ongoing process and that learning should stay both consistent and enjoyable.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>What I’ve Learned So Far</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Hands-on practice matters more than theory alone</li>
      <li>Strong fundamentals build confidence and speed later on</li>
      <li>Documentation reinforces understanding</li>
      <li>Consistency beats short bursts of motivation</li>
      <li>The cybersecurity community is a massive learning resource</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      My focus remains on offensive security — especially penetration testing — while continuously strengthening foundational knowledge in digital forensics and vulnerability assessment.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>What’s Next</h2>
<p>
  Moving forward, my goal is to continue building professional experience while preparing for industry certifications focused on penetration testing and offensive security.
  I plan to further expand my personal projects and work toward publishing my first in-depth write-up, documenting my learning journey and contributing back to the cybersecurity community.
